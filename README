NAME
    ShipIt::Step::ChangePodVersion - Keep VERSION in your Pod in sync with
    $VERSION

VERSION
    Version 0.04

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

        perl Build.PL
        ./Build
        ./Build test
        ./Build install

SYNOPSIS
    Just add it to the ShipIt config, maybe after the ChangeVersion-Step

        steps = FindVersion, ChangeVersion, ChangePodVersion, CheckChangeLog, ...

    And make sure you have a VERSION or at least a NAME section in your Pod.

        =head1 VERSION

        version 123

DESCRIPTION
    This is a Step for ShipIt to keep your Pod VERSION in sync with your
    $VERSION. If a VERSION section is discovered in your Pod, it is tried to
    find and replace numbers or "." or "_" within this section with your new
    version.

    You can write whatever you want before your version-number, but make
    sure it does not contain numbers or "." or "_".

    In case no VERSION section is found, a VERSION section is created after
    the NAME section. If no NAME section is found, we die.

    By default all your modules' Pod VERSION sections are updated to the
    files' $VERSION. Add ChangePodVersion.all to your shipit config and set
    it to 0 to change only the Pod of your distribution package.

    In case no $VERSION is found in your package, we don't die, but continue
    with other packages.

CONFIG
  ChangePodVersion.all
    DEFAULT 1

    Set this config value to 0 to deactivate VERSION Changes for all your
    dists modules. Only the dist-packages' Pod VERSION will be changed then.

WARNING
    The code to change all Modules' Pod VERSION is not automatically tested
    yet, because it is hard to write tests for it. I use it with
    HTTP::Exception now and didn't notice any problems, although automatic
    testing is better than having not experienced any problems. If you
    encounter problems, just deactivate it with ChangePodVersion.all = 0 and
    drop me an email.
