NAME

ShipIt::Step::ChangePodVersion - Keep VERSION in your Pod in sync with $VERSION

DESCRIPTION

This is a Step for ShipIt to keep your Pod VERSION in sync with your $VERSION.
If a VERSION section is discovered in your Pod, it is tried to find and replace
numbers or "." or "_" with your new version.

You can write whatever you want before your version-number, but make sure it
does not contain numbers or "." or "_".

In case no VERSION section is found, a VERSION section is created after the
NAME section. If no NAME section is found, we die.
